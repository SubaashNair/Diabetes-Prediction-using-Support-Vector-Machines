This project aims to predict the onset of diabetes using Support Vector Machines (SVM) with an accuracy of 76%. The model was developed using Python, scikit-learn, Jupyter, Pandas, NumPy, and Gradio for building a user-friendly prediction interface.

## Features

- Feature selection using Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and Logistic Regression
- Data standardization using StandardScaler from scikit-learn
- Interactive web app for prediction using Gradio

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Diabetes-Prediction-using-Support-Vector-Machines.git


2. Install the required dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt


3. Run the Jupyter notebook:


4. Open the `Diabetes_Prediction_SVM.ipynb` file and execute the cells to train the model and launch the Gradio app.
